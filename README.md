# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Journey

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity learning repository. This project documents my progression in cybersecurity, with a strong focus on **SOC (Security Operations Center)** operations and **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** frameworks.

## 🎯 Goals
- Develop SOC playbooks for real-world scenarios.
- Practice log analysis and detection engineering.
- Document governance policies aligned with NIST and ISO 27001.
- Build detection rules using Sigma and deploy to SIEM.
- Explore compliance through audits and templates.

## 📂 Structure
- `SOC/`: Detection engineering, playbooks, SIEM rules, and log analysis.
- `Governance/`: GRC policies, compliance docs, and risk assessments.
- `Tools/`: Configurations for Wazuh, ELK, Suricata, Sigma.
- `Labs/`: Practical exercises and case studies.
- `Notes/`: General research, frameworks, and methodologies.
